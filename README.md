# Warsztaty_1
This is workshop #1 of the course by CodersLab for Amelco

the tasks are following:
1. Number Guessing game - user guesses a random-generated number, inputs his guesses, computer provides hints
2. LOTTO simulator - the program simulates the lottery, user inputs 6 numbers of choice
  and is informed of results (how many numbers were correct)
3. Number Guessing game 2 - computer guesses a number, user provides hints using console commands
4. Dice - program simulates throwing different types of dice, user inputs what kind of dice to throw,
  how many throws are to be made and what optional operation should be performed after the throws (eg. addition)
  the program then performs the chosen operation and returns the result
5. WordSearch - using JSoup, searches for the most popular words in titles on a website, creates a file containing 
  them (ignores words shorter than 3 characters), then creates another file, excludes words given in a list 
  of excluded words (eg. and, why, because), and writes the remaining most popular words to that file.
